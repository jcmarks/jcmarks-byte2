<h1>Boulder Canyon Climbing Crags Byte 1</h1>
<p>When deciding where climb, climbers typically reference books that detail all the climbs in an area.
In areas with large numbers of climbs, it can be difficult to decide on a climbing area (crag).</p>
<p>Although these books contain significant information about the climbs, they include vague location
 references (such as "by the no camping sign"), making it difficult to find a desired crag.</p>
<p>In addition to location, climbers have to make decisions about the type of climbing they (as a group) want to do. 
They have to conside the type, difficulty, and quality of climbing.</p>
<p>To help climbers make better decisions about where they should climb, I was interested in answering the following question:</p>
<h2>"How are different types of climbs geographically distributed in Boulder Canyon?"</h2>
<h3>Trad/Sport Classification</h3>
<p>Crags are classified on this map according to whether they have predominantly "traditional" or "sport" climbs.</p>
<p>These climbing styles require different gear, so knowing what a crag has to offer can help somebody plan ahead.
The details of the climbing area are reference within each location marker.</p>

<h3>Difficulty of Climbs at Crag</h3>
<p>Crags are classified on this map according to the predominant grade, or difficulty, of the climb. Green means the areas has
predominantly easy climbs, yellow is moderates, and red is difficult. This can help people decide on areas that will be appropriate to
their levels</p>
