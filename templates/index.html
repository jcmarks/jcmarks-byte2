	<h1>Byte 2: Snow Reports at Ski Resorts</h1>
        <p>I was interested in comparing different ski resorts geographically. Is skiing really better out west?
        How much snow do different resorts get? And does the rating of a resort depend on how much good snow there is?</p>
      </div>
<p>Data were collected about the status of various ski resorts on December 30, 2012.</p>
<p>This first visualization shows the visitor ratings of the different ski resorts. I was interested in seeing if there
was a particular geographic spread of ratings (e.g. the Rocky Mountains are more highly rated). It seems that there was no correlation
between geographic area and visitor rating.</p>
<p>To some degree, this makes sense. People are likely to visit places that they enjoy, and they are likely to participate in studies
to rank resorts that they care about.</p>

<p>To explore the question of ratings more, I looked at a histogram of the different ratings. This was an attempt to determine
how meaningful user ratings are are determining differences. Ski resorts offer a wide variety of amenities, and there are a lot of differences 
between resorts, including lifts, runs, vertical rise, and other on-site amenities. 
I wanted to see if people are reflecting this distribution in their ratings.</p>
<p>Most of the ratings  fell into either a 2.5 to 3.0 range
or a 4.0 to 4.5 range. It is interesting that this subjective measure is unable to provide a good metric for really comparing; instead we just see two real classes of ski resort quality.
This chart also shows a data correctness problem: some of the resorts did not receive ratings, but they are showing up in the plot as being rated "0". This is not to say that
they are bad resorts, only that they have missing data. The second histogram was developed after cleaning these data to remove the values for which there were no reviews.</p>

<p>In the hopes of getting a better picture for the season rather than for a specific day, I looked at base depth of the snow at different resorts.
Here, we can see a difference in the geographical distribution of high snowfall areas. Places along mountain ranges show a higher overall snow accumulation than
ski resorts tucked into valleys.</p>
<iframe width="500" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col1+from+1tBVNF8c2RcQaVO5tAoXnBhg9cmn0V0S0gTangC-r&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=35.187067103889284&amp;lng=-94.93769185000002&amp;t=1&amp;z=4&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe>
<p>I also looked at overnight snow accumulation at different resorts. Is there a huge spread on snow reporting? Most of the resorts reported small amounts of snowfall.
Unfortunately, the data that were available were only for this one snapshot in time, a day which seemed to have relatively little snow. </p>

<p>Next, I visualized the open lifts. December is still early into the ski season, so lift are often not open. Comparing it to the previous map, I got a good sense 
for how much snow depth matters: it appears that the areas with greater snow depth have more of their lifts open, a fact which makes sense because you have to cover
all the hazards to skis with snow before you can ski on it!</p>
